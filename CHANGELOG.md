# Change log

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

- Under-the-hood changes to support the incoming 2FA sharing feature
- Replace tabbar labels with icons

### Fixed

- [issue #539](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/539) Chrome extension displays abnormally at 125% zoom

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- QR Code Capture: The extension can now detect and read QR codes on the active web page to ease 2FA registration. Once decoded, the underlying 2FA data is automatically added to your 2FAuth account. ([#410](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/410))
- Translations for all supported languages in 2FAuth.
- The Group-less filter.

### Changed

- The Chrome/Edge extension no longer runs in the background after the browser has been closed.

### Fixed

- [issue #461](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/461) l.forEach is not a function
- [issue #491](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/491) e.value.filter & t.value.find is not a function
- [issue #512](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/512) Unauthorized Data cannot be refreshed from server

## [1.1.2] - 2025-07-04

### Changed

- The extension is now built using the brand new [2FAuth component libraries](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth-Components). These libraries contain the common front-end components used by the web extension and web app.
- Requests receiving a 401 unauthorized response from the server now push the user to a dedicated view (instead of displaying a notification) with the ability to reset the extension from this view. This should eliminate the need to uninstall and reinstall the extension when locked out due to an invalid token.
- The error view now displays the reason why an error has occured (when available)

### Fixed

- The 'All' group label does not update dynamically when browser language changes
- Blank popup right after extension reset

## [1.1.1] - 2025-04-09

### Fixed

- Possible lock-out if something goes wrong when the setup form is submitted
- The banner informing about preferences being managed by the administrator is no longer visible if locked preferences are not used in the extension.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-04-07

### Added

- A user preference to enable precalculation and display of the next OTP code. __Requires 2FAuth `v5.5.0`__  
  Don't be surprised if you don't see the next code right after enabling this option, the code fades in slowly in order to maintain good readability of the current code.
- The extension now starts searching as soon as the user starts typing, without having to explicitly give focus to the search field

### Changed

- The user preferences enforced by the server administrator are now applied. __Requires 2FAuth `v5.5.0`__

### Fixed

- [issue #453](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/453), [issue #459](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/459) Various errors that caused the extension to remain locked
